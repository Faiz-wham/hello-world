        This is a really <em>simple dish</em> to prepare and it's always a big 
        hit at parties. My father recommends:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>
            "Make this the night before so that the flavors have time to blend. 
            Just bring it up to room temperature before you serve it. In the winder, 
            try serving it warm."
        </p>
    </blockquote>
